## My Favorite Series

*Gotham*

>Gotham has been pitched as an origin tale for the city's iconic villains and do-good coppers - not a "Batman story." As a result, certain fans expect Bruce Wayne's involvement to be minor - while others believe that we'll see a much more hands-on version of the teenage billionaire (especially as he gets older and stronger in future seasons). Of course, the show doesn't premiere until fall 2014 - meaning potential viewers will have to wait awhile for answers. In the meantime, Fox has released a lengthy synopsis that provides a glimpse at what we can expect - as well as how the characters of Gordon and Wayne will be utilized.

*Girl From Nowhere: The Series*

>The plot revolves around Nanno, an enigmatic girl who transfers to different private schools in Thailand and exposes the students and faculty's stories of lies, secrets, and hypocrisy. Nanno on occasion lies to provoke others. She is revealed to be an immortal entity, punishing wrongdoers for their crimes and misdeeds. In Season 2, Nanno meets her match in newfound rival Yuri, who has a different, more revenge focused ideology and wants to take over Nanno's duties.

*Titans*

>Titans is an American superhero television series created by Akiva Goldsman, Geoff Johns, and Greg Berlanti. Based on the DC Comics superhero team the Teen Titans, the series depicts a group of young heroes who join forces in their fight against evil. Featured as members of the eponymous Titans are Dick Grayson (Brenton Thwaites), Kory Anders (Anna Diop), Rachel Roth (Teagan Croft), Gar Logan (Ryan Potter), Jason Todd (Curran Walters), Donna Troy (Conor Leslie), Hank Hall (Alan Ritchson), Dawn Granger (Minka Kelly), Rose Wilson (Chelsea Zhang), Conner Kent (Joshua Orpin), and Tim Drake (Jay Lycurgo).
